Graftergrads - Hardworking Undergraduates

<b>1: Description</b><br>
Graftergrads is a project that I have made which is powered by Polymer and Firebase. It's fundamental use is for the class of Digital Media 2017 at Canterbury Christ Church University (CCCU) to have a profile to showcase themselves in a professional environment. The decision to use polymer as Graftergrads's main library comes down to a few things.<br>
Firstly, as a student, I find it pivotal to try and keep up to date with the latest technologies and/or new concepts to adopt into my own work. I feel it demonstrates that I am always keen to learn, which in web development's very nature is a requirement.<br>
Secondly, the technology and features that are loaded into Polymer is very exciting, and I for one am an advocate of Progressive Web App's to take charge in the future to allow the internet to flourish into a great experience for any environment.<br>
And lastly, after some general research online about Polymer, I found it in my best interest to attend the Polymer Summit held in London. The summit really paved the way for me to make Polymer and Firebase my firm choice in development for this project. Watching the team behind Chrome, Polymer and Firebase talk about the potential of the Internet using their tools with such passion resonated with me.

<b>Note:</b>
While I have put so much time into this project, I am aware that there could always be changes made here and there to make it as efficient as possible. With that, I would like to share with you some of the many features that this Web App showcases.

<b>2: Features</b>

-- App Experience:<br>
If you have an Android device (such as a phone), go ahead and open the url to the web app: http://www.graftergrads.com and whilst on the site, go to the options bar and select the choice 'Add to Homescreen'. Now if you direct yourself to your phones main screen, you will find the Graftergrads's app located on one of your phone's home pages! Adding an icon along with the rest of your Native Apps to complete the aesthetic. Now if you open the app from this section you should notice how it 'looks' and 'feels' like an actual app. No longer do you have the url above, instead you should find the web app's main shell as the only user interface, which makes for a great user experience!

-- One Page Experience:<br>
Excluding the pages on the menu, the main application takes place all in one page, going from a thumbnail scroll view, to a full page view, without page changes or major loading times in between. Again this is thanks to the power of Polymer, which through animating, allows the web components to seamlessly inject into the main page. Through more development time, I would like to complete routing to allow more pages in the application to exist and follow the same pattern.

-- Web Standards:<br>
Again, something that I have tried to make a priority in my development is to adhere to the current Web Standards, and not to include any technologies in a finished production project that doesn't fulfill the correct experience on all devices. The same goes to any tools that may be deprecated in the near future. Leading to another decison in using Polymer, as it is pushing the standards across the board and is beind adopted by virtually all browser vendors.

<b>3: Future Features / W.I.P</b><br>

-- Offline Usage:<br>
While this is something I nearly accomplished, I felt it was a secondary objective in the timeframe of my development process.
However the main principle of this feature is as follows: When visiting the site, be it on a browser or on your homescreen version, go ahead and turn off your connection to the internet and reload the page. You should find that the app still works! This is all thanks to the Service Worker put in place and taking advantage of the Local Storage on your device. This is another feature that the web has been able to achieve in recent years, drawing comparisons from it's Native App counterpart.

<b>4: Thank You's</b><br>
This project, whilst being developed by me alone, would not have been completed without the help of others. With that, I would like to thank the following:
<p>My friends and family that have supported me no matter what. For listening to me talk about Web Development despite not even being remotely interested, I really appreciate it</p>
<p>Canterbury Christ Church University. Without the University, I would not have found my calling in web design, and thanks to the Digital Media course for helping me with pursuing my interest.</p>
<p>In particular, a special thanks to Tim Long, the course director of Digital Media. The help and guidance he has given me over the three years has been great. I found myself constantly challenging my own work through him and pushing it further with each project. Thank you for also helping me gain to the University's Shell, as it is exclusively designed for those studying Computer Science.</p>
<p>My course peers. Thank you for the good times over the three years, your talent and skills are something that inspired me to create this application. Extra thank you to those of you who set aside a few minutes of their time to be a part of my project.</p>
<p>The Polymer and Firebase team. Through your summit, documentation, tools and otherwise outstanding support to the community, without you all, I would not have been able to make Graftergrads what it is now.</p>
<p><b>I hope to keep pushing this further as an idea, but for now thank you everyone and enjoy! - Jack Gordon</b></p>
